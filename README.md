# FreeCodeCamp

Freecodecamp is a free learning resource that is provided through the generous support of a wide community.

The site offers various coding courses and programming challenges, as well as numerous "interview preparation" challenges. It is complemented with a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp?app=desktop&cbrd=1) channel that also covers a large selection of topics.

FreeCodeCamp is 100% free and, unlike a bootcamp, the certificates are completely self-paced.
