First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.

**Personal Note** on the Projects:

For the 'Servey Form', being my first actual project from FCC I simply went through the motions so as to see how it worked and what was needed. It passed with the minimum amount of effort on my part - I do have every intention to redo this one...

The remaining projects I simply attempt to emulate the example as well as I am able to. As an aside: Web development is not where I plan to go, I'm going through these units for self-learning / background knowledge.
