# Nest one Array within Another Array

You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

```javascript
const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
```

This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

-----

Create a nested array called `myArray`.

# Seed Code

```javascript
// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [];
```

# Solution

```javascript
// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [["Cheese", 5], ["Milk", 2]];
```
