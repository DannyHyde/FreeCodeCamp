# Increment a Number with JavaScript

You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

```javascript
i++;
```

is the equivalent of

```javascript
i = i + 1;
```

**Note:** The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

-----

Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.

# Seed Code

```javascript
let myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar + 1;
```

# Solution

```javascript
let myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar++;
```
