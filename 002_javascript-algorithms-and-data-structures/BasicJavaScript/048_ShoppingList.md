# Shopping List

Create a shopping list in the variable `myList`. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.

```javascript
["Chocolate Bar", 15]
```

-----

There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.

## Seed Code

```javascript
const myList = [];
```

## Solution

```javascript
const myList = [
  ["Milk", 5],
  ["Cheese", 1],
  ["Ham", 3],
  ["Chocolate", 16],
  ["Wine", 30],
];
```
