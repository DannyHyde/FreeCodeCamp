# Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication

The `*=` operator multiplies a variable by a number.

```javascript
myVar = myVar * 5;
```

will multiply `myVar` by `5`. This can be rewritten as:

```javascript
myVar *= 5;
```

-----

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `*=` operator.

## Seed Code

```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a = a * 5;
b = 3 * b;
c = c * 10;
```

## Solution

```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
```
